🧠 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student at UMKC, and I’m passionate about generative models, LLMs, intelligent agents, and bridging the gap between research and real products.
I aim to become a Generative AI Engineer who not only crafts models but also embeds them into robust systems that people can actually use. I care deeply about ethics, interpretability, and systems that scale.
My strengths include Python, JavaScript, ML/DL frameworks, prompt engineering, API design, and cloud deployment. I love collaborating across domain areas — product, research, design — to create AI that solves real problems.

💡 Highlight Projects
Project	Description & Highlights
AI-Powered Art Generator	Web app that uses stable diffusion / latent diffusion to generate images from text prompts. I built the prompt-engineering layer, backend API, and responsive UI.
Conversational Agent + Memory	An LLM-based agent that can respond, remember user context, and retrieve external knowledge (knowledge-augmented retrieval).
Document Summarization Tool	Tool that ingests long documents and outputs summaries with key points using transformer models and fine-tuning.
Intelligent Fitness Coach	Uses generated instructions, image/video feedback, and adaptive plans. Shows how AI can support real-world habits.
Portfolio Website + AI Showcase	This site, with interactive demos (e.g. “try the LLM here”), and embedded examples of my work with generative AI.
🏗️ What I Do as an Associate / Generative AI Engineer
As an Associate Generative AI Engineer, my role sits between research, engineering, and product. Here’s what I focus on day to day:
•	Design, train, and fine-tune generative AI models (e.g. text generation, image synthesis) using modern architectures like transformers, diffusion models, GANs, VAEs. Braintrust+2TestGorilla+2
•	Build scalable inference pipelines: model serving, batching, latency optimization, memory / cache systems.
•	Integrate AI models into applications: wrap with APIs or SDKs, build UI/UX hooks, embed in product architecture.
•	Prompt engineering and prompt tuning: crafting effective inputs to steer model behavior.
•	Evaluate model outputs: define metrics, human evaluation, benchmarking.
•	Monitor, maintain, and iterate models in production: track drift, do retraining, maintain versioning.
•	Collaborate with product managers, designers, data engineers, and domain experts to align on use cases, data needs, and requirement constraints.
•	Stay current: research new architectures, read papers, implement state-of-the-art ideas.
•	Uphold AI safety, fairness, transparency, and responsible practices (bias checks, explainability).
For a broader “AI Engineer” role, responsibilities also include building general AI systems, designing pipelines, solving applied ML problems, deploying models, etc. Recruiting Resources+2LinkedIn Business Solutions+2
✅ Qualifications & What I Bring
•	Solid foundations in machine learning, deep learning, probability, linear algebra, optimization.
•	Hands-on experience training and fine-tuning transformer and generative models.
•	Familiarity with Python ML ecosystem: Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
•	Experience in backend systems, APIs, and integrating models into full-stack applications.
•	Exposure to cloud infrastructure, containers, and deployment.
•	Strong collaboration and communication skills: able to explain AI decisions to non-technical stakeholders.
•	Growth mindset: eager to learn, adapt, read latest research, implement proofs-of-concept.
•	Ethical awareness: attention to fairness, biases, interpretability, model safety.
